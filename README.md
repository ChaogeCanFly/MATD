# MATD

Custom C++ code used for controlling our MATD during our tests in the paper titled 'A volumetric display for visual, tactile and audio presentation using acoustic trapping' (you can find the article here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1739-5 )

This program requires some external libralies:
- OpenCV libraly to handle image files for texture mapping: https://opencv.org/
- FFTW libraly to process audio signals: http://www.fftw.org/
- GLM libraly to handle matrix operations: https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html

This program also includes the files from a simple AudioFile library to handle audio files: https://github.com/adamstark/AudioFile
